# [Community Bounty #14 - Compile List of Polkadot/Substrate Content](https://github.com/Joystream/community-repo/issues/142)

*This bounty during the [Antioch](https://blog.joystream.org/antioch-released/) and [Sumer](https://blog.joystream.org/sumer-released/) testnets was managed by @tomato, discussed on the [forum](https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/358) and finalized in PR #157.*

[polkadot_substrate_content_list.csv](polkadot_substrate_content_list.csv) lists youtube channels and videos with **Polkadot/Substrate Content**.

For details about criteria see #142.

## Description

In order to get more high quality content available on the platform, that also have some educational value, we want to source content about Substrate (the framework Joystream is built on) and Polkadot.

We know there are podcasts, and likely Youtube (etc.) channels, with an emphasis on the progress and development for Polkadot and Substrate, but also other projects in the ecosystem.

There should also be plenty of "standalone content", such as talks, interview, conferences demonstrations, developer presentations, etc. These are also welcome, but there will be higher requirements to the quality of content, as there will be more overhead to get permissions.

## Reward

Up to $50 per channel, or $25 per podcast.

Up to $20 per video, and $10 per audio only content.
