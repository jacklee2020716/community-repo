## Council Status
Before we talk about the status of the working groups its important to note also the status of the council and platform in general:
* The Council has only agreed on a reporting system for the Storage working group, the council hasn't agreed on one for the Curator working group so far.
* The Council is lagging behind a bit with voting on proposals and submitting proposals for WGs (such as mint refill requests) has probably been quite difficult recently.

## Storage Working Group Status
The current status of this working group:
* The lead had been following the reporting requirements reasonably well
* Only one storage provider has responded to the tasks agreed upon by the council: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/319 (this will be reviewed separately to this report)
* The workers are being paid and their storage providers are up
* One worker has reported that the total content storage size plus blockchain size has meant they are utilizing 175GB out of 195GB capacity, this means a budget increase for this working group is necessary in the very near future.

## Curator Working Group Status
The current status of this working group:
* The lead is responsive on the forums / chat
* The group seems to have accomplished most of the tasks agreed on by the council: https://testnet.joystream.org/#/forum/threads/320 (this will be reviewed separately to this report)
* The lead has hired two workers
* The group overall seems to be progressing quite well with work and has produced several threads on the forums and is also working on Discord to communicate to content creators about issues.
