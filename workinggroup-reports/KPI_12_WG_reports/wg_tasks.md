## Storage WG Tasks

1. What is the storage capacity of each individual server now?
2. Is it possible to show how much bandwidth each server has consumed over the past week or month? If there are no tools installed for this currently, it may be possible to get this information from the server host (ex. Vultr shows the bandwidth use of each server on a daily basis going back a month)
3. What are the approximate costs of each server, and do the current worker payments cover these?


## Curator WG Tasks

1. Hire 2 curator workers during the council session, preferably at least one bilingual curator as we have a lot of Russian language content that has to be reviewed. Make sure the openings for these have clear deadlines as we have a backlog of uncurated videos.

2. Once hired, post a thread on the forums indicating the language/timezone of the curation team

3. Update the featured videos twice during the rest of this council session and include links to the featured videos and a basic reasoning.

4. Post on the forums with a number of how many videos are uncurated. Once this is done, perform as much curation as is possible and provide an update on the status of uncurated videos at the end of the council session.
