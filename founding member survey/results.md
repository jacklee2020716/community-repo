|:-|:-|:-|
| make easy tool to get actual validators statistics, change Keybase to Discord or Telegram, maybe prepare some auto-generated templates for submitting reports in the current scoring period (date can be filled automatically for the current period)  | %    |
| Make submission process as easy as possible. Preferably via web UI. Without needing to think about a format of submission text. As less paperwork as possible.   | %    |
| I think i missed all the idea of this so maybe a guide on what this role is about and how it can be awarded can make sense. Sure, it is already done.   | %    |
| It will help a lot if I know for what activity how many points are awarded. Then I would deliberately change course towards more reward.   | %    |
| maybe some platform where we can submit every thing we did to joystream   | %    |
| Make a convenient form on the website for submitting reports   | %    |
| the system of reports is very understandable for me   | %    |
| No screenshot for node), i don't like to make it)   | %    |
| Make a webpage with online reporting and logging.   | %    |
| The "validator" report could be simplified a lot   | %    |
| Nothing, everything is great and convinient   | %    |
| To know when is the end of current period.   | %    |
| to be honest, I'm already used to it   | %    |
| this form of filing is acceptable   | %    |
| Nothing, I'm used to it.   | %    |
| At the moment,it's ok.   | %    |
| Report submission form   | %    |
| I just need more time   | %    |
| I'm thinking about it   | %    |
| simplify the process   | %    |
