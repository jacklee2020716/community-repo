## Installation with script

Login as root, then do:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IeSua-lab/community-repo/scriptnodeSetup/community-contributions/scriptnodeSetup/joystream-node-install.sh

./joystream-node-install.sh
```

Script will install the node. At the end of the installation, it will ask you what to name your node.   
Works as root and user.
