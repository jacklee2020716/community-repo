## Council + Tokenomics Overview
This table shows statistics from the end of each council session, including token generation information. It can be used as an overview of both tokenomics and how things change between council sessions.

## Council Member Leaderboard
This table shows how often each council member participates in voting for proposals.
Notes:
* Once a proposal is finalized it cannot be voted on further, so a lower number does not necessarily mean a council member did not want to vote, it may just be the proposal passed before they had a chance to.
* Canceled proposals and proposals that do not successfully get voted on by the current council are not included.
* An `x` means the CM was not elected during that council session
